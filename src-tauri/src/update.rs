//! Support for the in-app updater.

//! The update check and install themselves live in `tauri-plugin-updater` and
//! are driven from the frontend; what can't be answered there is whether this
//! particular install is one the updater is able to replace, and how to reach
//! the user when the window isn't on screen.

/// Whether this build can install an update over itself.

/// On Linux the updater only knows how to swap out a running AppImage — a
/// `.deb` or `.rpm` install is owned by the system package manager, and
/// letting the updater loose on it would either fail or leave the package
/// database describing a version that is no longer on disk. Those installs are
/// pointed at the release page instead. Every other platform installs through
/// its own bundle, which the updater can always replace.
